# MiniIO Portable WASM

Use this when creating or revising a MoonBit executable for portable tools,
Codex skills, or other agent workflows that should work outside this repository
after `moon add moonbit-community/miniio`.

## Start

- For a new tool, copy `assets/miniio-cli/` and rename the module/package.
- For an existing tool, add the dependency with `moon add moonbit-community/miniio`.
- Keep the package target to WASM and make the package main-only:

```moonbit
import {
  "moonbit-community/miniio",
}

supported_targets = "wasm"

options(
  is_main: true,
)
```

Do not add explicit export-memory linker config. Current MoonBit toolchains add
the needed memory export for `is_main: true` WASM executables.

## I/O Rules

- Read args with `@miniio.args_get()`. `args[0]` is the executable name, so
  command arguments start at `args[1]`.
- Use `@miniio.stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` for stdio.
- Use `@miniio.read_text_file` and `write_text_file` for UTF-8 text.
- Use `@miniio.read_json_file` and `write_json_file` for JSON config and
  manifest files.
- Use `@miniio.copy_file` when copying bytes from one guest path to another.
- Use `@miniio.read_file`, `write_file`, `open`, `create`, `readdir`, and
  `rmdir` for lower-level file work.
- Use `remove_file` when the path must be a file, `rmdir` when it must be a
  directory, and `remove` only when accepting either is intentional.
- Use `create_mode=CreateOrTruncate`, `OpenExisting`, or `CreateNew` instead of
  boolean creation flags.
- Treat every filesystem path as guest-visible. WASIp1 has no ambient cwd.
- `moon run` and `moon test` are useful development runners, but their WASI
  sandbox only exposes the working/project directory. Keep test fixtures under
  that tree when using Moon's runner.
- Document required preopens. For example, a program reading `data/input.txt`
  needs a run command such as:

```sh
wasmtime run --dir ./data::data _build/wasm/debug/build/<module>/<package>.wasm data/input.txt
```

## Validate

Run these before handoff:

```sh
moon check
moon test
moon build
```

Prefer `moon run <pkg> <args>` for quick development tests.
