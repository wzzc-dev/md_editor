# moonbitlang/parser/fmt

`moonbitlang/parser/fmt` is a code formatter for the MoonBit. This package was 
created with the following goals in mind:

- Ensure readability and consistent code formatting.
- Provide a single "true" formatting style, with no configuration required, making it easy to adopt across teams.
- Guarantee idempotence: formatting the code multiple times yields the same result after the first application.
- Properly handle comments and merge blank lines.

**Warning: This package is highly experimental and work in progress.**

## Status

* [x] Parenthesis inference
* [x] Expression layout composition
* [x] Expression formatting
* [x] Top-level declaration formatting
* [ ] Comment formatting
* [ ] Blank line awareness
* [ ] Fully test coverage

## Usage

```mbt check
///|
test {
  let code =
    #|/// Tree data structure
    #|pub enum Tree[T] { Empty; Node(Tree[T], T, Tree[T]) }derive(Show)
    #|
    #|/// Greet a person
    #|pub fn hello(name:String)->Unit{ let str = "hello, \{name}!"; println(str) } 
  let result = @fmt.format(code)
  inspect(
    result,
    content=(
      #|///|
      #|/// Tree data structure
      #|pub enum Tree[T] {
      #|  Empty
      #|  Node(Tree[T], T, Tree[T])
      #|} derive(Show)
      #|
      #|///|
      #|/// Greet a person
      #|pub fn hello(name : String) -> Unit {
      #|  let str = "hello, \{name}!"
      #|  println(str)
      #|}
      #|
